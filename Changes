Revision history for Perl extension Linux::DesktopFiles.

0.25  2017-10-22
    - `parse_desktop_file()` and `parse_desktop_files()` are now context-sensitive, returning a key-value list or a HASH reference, depending on the context.
    - Documentation improvements.

0.24  2017-10-21
    - When `keep_unknown_categories` is true and a given entry does not belong to any category, `parse_desktop_file` will set `Categories` to [`unknown_category_key`].

0.23  2017-10-21
    - Escaped strings are now unescaped.
    - Added the `parse_desktop_file` method, which parses a single desktop file.

0.22  2017-10-04
    - Make sure the category names are unique, so we don't store an application twice under the same category.

0.21  2017-09-21
    - Fixed a minor bug for icon names that contain one or more dots (e.g.: "foo.bar.baz").
      Thanks to Erik Dubois for reporting this issue (https://github.com/trizen/obmenu-generator/issues/16).

0.20  2017-09-15
    - Added support for desktop IDs.
      When a desktop entry is located under a local directory,

    - More performance improvements.
    - Added the "parse" method which can parse a list of desktop files.
    - Removed the "iterate_desktop_files" method. (it's faster to use the "get_desktop_files" method instead)
